# Basic Git commands


``$ git <command> <options>``

E.g.

>- ``git add myfile.txt``
>- ``git status``
>- ``git commit -m "add myfile"``
>- ``git log``


# Episode 5: Recovering Older Versions of a File

Which commands below will let you recover the last committed version of the Python script called data_cruncher.py?


1. ``$ git restore HEAD``
2. ``$ git restore data_cruncher.py``
3. ``$ git restore -s HEAD~1 data_cruncher.py``
4. ``$ git restore -s <unique ID of last commit> data_cruncher.py``


# Episode 5: Reverting a Commit

Below are the right steps and explanations for Jennifer to use ``git revert``^[The command ``git revert`` undoes the changes made a particular commit.], what is the missing command?

1. ``________ # Look at the git history of the project to find the commit ID``
2. Copy the ID (the first few characters of the ID, e.g. 0b1d055).
3. ``git revert [commit ID]``
4. Type in the new commit message.
5. Save and close



# Episode 5: Understanding Workflow and History

What is the output of the last command in: 

``$ cd planets``\
``$ echo "Venus is beautiful and full of love" > venus.txt``\
``$ git add venus.txt``\
``$ echo "Venus is too hot to be suitable as a base" >> venus.txt``\
``$ git commit -m "Comment on Venus as an unsuitable base"``\
``$ git restore venus.txt``\
``$ cat venus.txt``

\pause

Answer: ``Venus is beautiful and full of love``

# Episode 6: Ignoring Nested Files

Given a directory structure that looks like:

``results/data``\
``results/plots``

How would you ignore only ``results/plots`` and not ``results/data``?

\pause

``results/plots/``

# Episode 6: Including specific files

How would you ignore all ``.dat`` files in your root directory except for ``final.dat?``

Hint: Find out what ! (the exclamation point operator) does

\pause

``*.dat           # ignore all data files``\
``!final.dat      # except final.data``


# Episode 6: Ignoring Nested Files: Variation

Given a directory structure that looks similar to the earlier Nested Files exercise, but with a slightly different directory structure:

``results/data``\
``results/images``\
``results/plots``\
``results/analysis``

How would you ignore all of the contents in the results folder, but not results/data?

Hint: think a bit about how you created an exception with the ! operator before.

\pause

``results/*               # ignore everything in results folder``\
``!results/data/          # do not ignore results/data/ contents``

# Episode 9: A Typical Worksession

Put the following actions in order, and give the commands needed to achieve the action:

- Make changes by appending the number 100 to a text file numbers.txt
- Update remote repository to match the local repository
- Celebrate your success with some fancy beverage(s)
- Update local repository to match the remote repository
- Stage changes to be committed
- Commit changes to the local repository

# Open Science

- Git and GitHub are great for transparency: every one can see the work you have done.
- But: it may not be the best for scientific archiving. (Is your repo guaranteed to be accessible for 10 years?)
- Use the OSF to archive github repos, and get a DOI


# Git in Practice

- I am a big fan!
- It declutters your hard drive (and head) by removing the need to keep track of versions
- GitHub can be linked to OSF and Zenodo
- No need to use command line
